For this game, I started by haing all of my questions ready so that I could know what kind of trivia game it was going to be. I decided on making a random trivia game with questions that do not usually go in the same categories.

Then I made the buttons for each answer option and the start and restart game. The reason I started from the bottom was because I wanted the content on my page first in order to style the page in a way where I can see where things are going instead of changing them around if I see that things aren't going/looking the way I wanted it to.


The entire background turns red when the answer is wrong and green when the answer is right.
